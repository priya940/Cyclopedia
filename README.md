Created an interactive Dictionary app with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Dictionary api where users can search for word definitions by entering a word in the input field and clicking the search button. Users enter a word in the input field and click a search button, triggering a JavaScript function. This function handles user input validation and sends an API request to DictionaryAPI to retrieve word definitions. Upon receiving the API response, it updates the webpage with the wordâ€™s definition.
